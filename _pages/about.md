I am a theoretical astrophysicist with broad interests in the physics of the interstellar medium, galaxy formation, large-scale structure, astrophysical fluid dynamics, astrochemistry, condensed matter physics, and molecular dynamics. At the intersection of all of these, my primary focus is cosmic dust - the tiny solid particles that pervade the space between the stars.
